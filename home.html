    <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
    <p>World Class Programs is a collective of like-minded
      individuals who are passionate about cultural education.
      Teaching the future of the world is our passion and we work
      every day to improve.
      We recogize that in order for us to raise a considerate and
      world-conscious next generation, we need to focus on global
      education in high school. We bring the curriculum alive with
      valuable experiences and cultural immersion opportunities.
      Along with educational benefits, students will meet
      new people from around the world, and experience a new way of
      life different from their own. All of this combines to form the
      ultimate summer experience with World Class Programs.</p>

  <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
  <p>Superior, eye-opening education is our goal and safety
    is our priority. Giving students the opportunity to travel
    abroad, experience new cultures, and gain a different
    perspective on the world is what we aim to do.
    There is a need for students to have teachers that aren't
    just passionate about learning but passionate about students.
    We tailor our programs each year to the students that attend
    our programs. Students fill out detailed questionaires about
    THEIR interests and THEIR goals for the summer.
    Our staff take these into account when developing the programs
    schedules. In order to maintain this unique and tailored experience
    across all programs, we keep our staff to student ratio 6:1 or better.</p>
