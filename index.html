    <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
    <p>World Class Programs is a collective of like-minded
      individuals who are passionate about cultural education.
      Teaching the future of the world is our passion and we work
      every day to improve.
      We recogize that in order for us to raise a considerate and
      world-conscious next generation, we need to focus on global
      education in high school. We bring the curriculum alive with
      valuable experiences and cultural immersion opportunities.
      Along with educational benefits, students will meet
      new people from around the world, and experience a new way of
      life different from their own. All of this combines to form the
      ultimate summer experience with World Class Programs.</p>

  <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
  <p>Superior, eye-opening education is our goal and safety
    is our priority. Giving students the opportunity to travel
    abroad, experience new cultures, and gain a different
    perspective on the world is what we aim to do.
    There is a need for students to have teachers that aren't
    just passionate about learning but passionate about students.
    We tailor our programs each year to the students that attend
    our programs. Students fill out detailed questionaires about
    THEIR interests and THEIR goals for the summer.
    Our staff take these into account when developing the programs
    schedules. In order to maintain this unique and tailored experience
    across all programs, we keep our staff to student ratio 6:1 or better.</p>

    <h3>TELL ME ABOUT SAFETY</h3>
    <p>We offer programs around the world. Our program destinations
      are selected based off a few criteria: cultural richness,
      safety, and accessibility. Our goal on each program is to
      provide for our students a place to learn and grow safely.
      The ability for our students to be independent is contingent
      on the high safety standards we set in place. Because of this,
      World Class Programs performs routine safety checks in each
      program destination for six months leading up to the program
      date. Apartments are thoroughly vetted and all of our staff
      members receive background checks yearly. We only hire trusted
      education professionals from around the US and the world. </p>

  <h3>TYPICAL DAY</h3>
  <p>Each day you'll start with your major class that you've selected
    to attend five days a week from 9 until noon. After lunch,
    you'll either attend your minor class (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday)
    or you'll participate in an afternoon activity!
    Students will also have the option to attend an evening
    activity with the staff. These activies might include a concert,
    a night photography excursion, philosophy symposiums, karaoke, etc.
    After the evening activity, students will have dinner either with staff
    or with the new friends they've made abroad!
    On the weekends, students take day trips around their host country. Depending
    on the length of the trip and the program, students will sometimes stay overnight
    on these daytrips.</p>
